                <h4>New Adventures</h4>
                <p>From great hiking trails with astonishing views, drunk karaoke boat rides with a bunch of friends, and amazing hidden waterfalls. Different parts of Lao offers hostels for that backpacker who is budgeting, or homestays, which are like air BnBs with meals included by the owner.  Rent a bike or motorscooter to explore the towns. Or take a Tuk-Tuk to taste the local cuisines, and just bask in the ambience of a place where life... "takes it's time." That is just to name a fraction of the <em>many</em> things that you'll discover in Lao. You might even find yourself again.  Bring a translator.</p>

                <h4>Laid back people</h4>
                <p>Our people are devout in their religions, and they devote their lives to living by it's teachings.  They have a live and let live mindset, and if you can find yourself a translator. There isn't anything they wouldn't do for you.  I have found that it's the language barrier that keep us, from forming a bonding fiendship with the locals.  Meet the Lao people and help support the local businesses, and get to know them.  Remember that in alot of places in Lao, the economy is mainly supported by tourism.  Meaning that they feed their families, clothe their children and send their kids to school directly from your kind patronage.</p>

                <h4>Worth your money</h4>
                <p>The largest hurdle I have found, is getting there.  But that is an adventure in itself.  Getting there could take up to three days with changing flights, and layovers to finally make a footprint in the place we call Lan Xang.  But if you do manage to make it over to Laos, you will find that your currency goes <em>farrr.</em> Outside of the plane ticket and traveling gear costs(clothes, toiletries, and maybe pepto-bismol. lol), set aside some money for FUN.  You'll discover that the cost of having FUN is <em>very affordable.</em> Also, if the price isn't listed.  Practice your negotiation skills, and have fun with it. It's also nice to have a translator.</p>
